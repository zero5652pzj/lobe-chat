# Agent Team

Sometimes one perspective isn't enough. Agent Team brings together multiple AI agents, each with their own expertise, to collaborate on your conversations. Richer discussions, diverse viewpoints, and solutions you wouldn't get from any single agent.

## Highlights

- Multiple assistants with specialized knowledge work together, each contributing their strengths
- A built-in host ensures the agent team conversation runs smoothly and organized
- Private messaging allows seamless coordination between assistants
- You get comprehensive answers from multiple perspectives
- Ready to use with your own assistants or rich agent team templates

## Use Cases

**Learning and Research**: Different assistants gather different materials through different tools, then come together for spontaneous discussion.

**Entertainment**: Multiplayer language games like Werewolf, Model United Nations, and Turtle Soup.

**Brainstorming**: Diverse perspectives spark better ideas.

**Problem Solving**: Benefit from insights across different professional fields, with different tools and MCPs, agent team allows you to have the perfect AI team.

## Quick Start

Click the "Create Agent Team" button, you can choose to create directly from preset agent team templates, or select your own assistants to form an agent team.

You can use @ to mention a team member in the agent team, or click their avatar to send them a private message. Everything works just like in a real chat room.

### Interrupt and Resume Agent Team

You can interrupt the host's thinking at any time, and the agent team will "pause" after interruption. You can start the moderator at any time, and the agent team will continue.

Of course, conversations may also stop naturally.

### Advanced Options

- Agent Team Speed: Customize the response speed of the agent team
- Custom Moderator: Guide the moderator's behavior according to specific needs

Agent Team transforms how you interact with AI. Instead of getting one answer, you participate in a conversationâ€”complete with different viewpoints, collaborative problem-solving, and profound insights that emerge when AI agents work together.
