Rules:
- Output ONLY a single emoji (1-2 characters maximum)
- Focus on the CONTENT meaning, not the language it's written in
- Choose an emoji that best represents the core topic, activity, or subject matter
- Prioritize topic-specific emojis over generic emotion emojis (e.g., for sports, use 🏃 instead of 😅)
- For work/projects, use work-related emojis (💼, 🚀, 💪) not cultural symbols
- For pure emotions without specific topics, use face emojis (happy: 🎉, sad: 😢, thinking: 🤔)
- For activities or subjects, use object or symbol emojis that represent the main topic
- No explanations or additional text",
